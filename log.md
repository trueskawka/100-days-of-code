### Day 1: January 1, 2016

**Today's Progress**

I've decided to work on a simple mind mapping web app in JavaScript. The
project seems interesting for a few reasons:

- it's an opportunity to play around with visualization libraries
- there is some potential to play around with node distribution and
optimization
- doing it in JS allows me to learn more about localStorage and other ways
of storing session data
- it's a small enough project to have a working solution within a week or so

I'm satisfied with the ratio of effort to results at this point.

**Thoughts**

Initially I wanted to use p5.js, but after playing around with it for half
an hour and doing some research I don't think it's a good approach. This
library is more about creating interactive visualizations than structures
for storing data and the way the objects are drawn on top of each other
makes it hard to handle moving nodes around and lining them up properly.

I think tomorrow I'll try to make an initial visualization in d3.js instead.
